Mercedes-Benz issued a notice stating the waiting time for new cars has increased recently. The German automaker is 
the #1 luxury car seller in India. The reason behind this delay is the short supply of the Integrated Circuit(IC) chips 
which are mostly used in the steering wheels and for navigation purpose. Companies had to cut down on their production
during the lockdown period last year. The major semiconductor producing company is TSMC from Taiwan with a whooping 50% 
and more market share. During lockdown the sale of computers and other electronic devices touched new heights, therefore 
most of the supply was directed in that direction.
