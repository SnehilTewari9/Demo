Mercedes-Benz published a notice recently stating the waiting time for new cars has increased recently. The German automaker is the #1 luxury car seller in India. The reason behind this delay is the short supply of the Integrated Circuit(IC) chips which are mostly used in the steering wheels and for navigation purpose. Companies had to cut down on their production during the lockdown period last year. As the auto sector is reviving slowly the demand for these chips have risen.
